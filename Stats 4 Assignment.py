# # Problem Statement 1:
 Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were
surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they
obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

           High School Bachelors Masters  Ph.d.  Total
Female     60          54        46       41     201
Male       40          44        53       57     194
Total      100         98        99       98     395

Question: 
    Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In
other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the
gender of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?
